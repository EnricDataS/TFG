# LAI Reconstruction â€“ Experiments

This repository contains experimental work for the Bachelor's Final Thesis (TFG) project on the reconstruction of Leaf Area Index (LAI) data. It includes Google Colab notebooks and CSV files used to conduct, log, and analyze experiments across different setups.

## Repository Structure

Each folder contains notebooks and CSV logs related to specific experiments:

- **Evaluation for year 2008**  
  Experiments evaluating model performance on LAI prediction for the year 2008.

- **Evaluation of Varying Training Set Size for year 2005**  
  Analysis of how different training set sizes affect model performance, focused on data from 2005.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning (Region 11)**  
  Hyperparameter search experiments for models trained on Region 11 data.

## Usage

Open the notebooks in Google Colab to explore or reproduce experiments. Each notebook is paired with a corresponding CSV log file tracking the experiment outputs.

## Project Context

This repository is part of a broader project on LAI reconstruction. For full context, datasets, and code and model details, see the main project repo:
